# Druids

  - Druids are Divine Casters.

  - Druids, like Clerics, are tied to an aspect of the Konun Oluhiyat, specifically [Jayyak](/03_cosmology/07_jayyak_the_rampant_lion.md).

  - Resist Natureâ€™s Lure provides a bonus against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of all Djinns (Ifrits, Marids, Peris, and Deevs).

  - Druids are not restricted from casting alignment-based spells (though there may be moral implications).
