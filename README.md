# Mishaqqa
## A D&amp;D 3.5 / Pathfinder 1e Homebrew Campaign Setting

### The Concept
Mishaqqa is a world based on Middle Eastern lore and mythology. _A Thousand and One Arabian Nights_ and _The Shahnameh_ are primary inspirations, as well as the various real-world myths and legends of ancient Persia, the Arabian Peninsula, the Levant, and even into India. Other inspirations are the works of S.A. Chakraborty and Chelsea Abdullah, among others.

In developing the world, I am striving for a degree of realism to go with my Wizards Chucking Fireballs. I clearly expect that this is not everyone's cup of tea, and I respect that. Having my character get knocked down three times and revivied by healing potions and shouts from a local cleric, sleeping it off for 8 hours, and waking up ready to party is not _my_ particular brand of tea, but I'm not going to deny that 5E is a decent RPG that has expanded the hobby's horizons. If you enjoy this, great. If you don't, well, also great. Enjoy _something_.

### The Tropes
First and foremost, I want to subvert or outright avoid a number of tropes.
- It's high fantasy, but it isn't Eurocentric high fantasy.
- To whit: the people of Mishaqqa are almost universally Not Caucasian.
- There are many races, but they are fundamentally all human. 
- Some of those races are heavily influenced by typical fantasy races, but no one has pointy ears.
- Just like the real world, those races don't always get along.
- Some of those races are treated with veiled or outright contempt.
- Aside from simurghs (rocs), djinn, and dragons, there are no sentient non-playable races. Villains are people. Tread carefully.
- Language is important and there is no "Common."

### The Game
- It's OK for rules to be complex, as long as they make sense and are easy to enact.
- But it's best to strive for simplicity.
- There is no need to reinvent the wheel, but the wheel can definitely be improved.
