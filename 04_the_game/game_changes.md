# Game Changes

## Classes Allowed
Playable classes are: Bard, Cleric, Druid, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Rogue, Wizard
(Apologies to anyone who wanted to play a Barbarian, Ranger, or Sorcerer.)

## Leveling Up
Increasing in level is not an automatic process. While skill rank increases and level adjustments happen immediately when a character has enough experience to increase their level, they must spend at least four days in training, prayer, study, or meditation in order to access the special abilities of their new level.

## Multiclassing
Character classes are more than just descriptions. Learning even the basic skills of each class takes training, and training takes time. In order to have access to any of the abilities of a new class, a character needs at least a month of downtime spent with an instructor, who must have at least four levels in that class.

## Divine Casters (Clerics, Druids, Paladins):
- ### Patron
  - All Divine Casters must select a patron from the Konun Oluhiyat. (Players may not select Zhas’ni as a patron).

- ### Spell Preparation
  - Divine Casters may prepare a number of spells of any level equal to Caster Level + (2 x WIS Mod).

- ### Spell Casting
  - Divine Casters may cast any spell as many times as their spell slots will allow.

- ### Stretching Limits
  - Divine Casters may attempt to continue to cast spells beyond their allotment for the day. A Divine Caster attempting to cast a spell for which they no longer have a spell slot remaining must first make a Fortitude save at DC 10 + Spell Level + Number of spells already attempted at that level (successful or otherwise). For example, a 9th-level cleric attempting to cast their third 5th level spell of the day would require a DC 17 Fortitude save (10 + 5 + 2). If the check is successful, the spell is cast normally. If the check fails, the Divine Caster becomes Fatigued. If they are already Fatigued, they become Exhausted. If they are already Exhausted, they become Nauseated and lose all remaining spell slots of all levels (including the ability to cast orisons). The Nauseated condition persists until the character has rested for at least an hour, at which point they revert to being Exhausted.

- ### Orisons
  - Orisons require minimal effort. Divine casters that have access to Orisons may cast them at  will and they require no spell slots to cast.

- ### Multiclassing

  - #### Caster Level
    - Divine Casters who multiclass into other Divine Caster classes increase their Caster Level when they gain a new level in another Divine Caster class. However, their spells per day max out at base 4 for each level, and they may not cast spells at any level higher than either of their classes would have at their specific level. Example: a 9th level paladin/4th level cleric would have an effective Caster Level of 13, but only have access to 3rd level spells. Multiclassed Clerics still only get the +1 Domain slot per day as per their Cleric level.

  - #### Spell Casting
    - Divine Casters may only cast spells which their class has access to, but they may cast it with higher level spell slots from another class. For instance, a 10th level Cleric/3rd level Druid would be able to cast Detect Snares and Pits at 3rd level, but would be unable to cast Quench.

  - #### Patron Consistency
    - Druids and Paladins who multiclass into Cleric are restricted to domains associated with their chosen patron deity. Clerics who have a patron deity other than The Rampant Lion may not multiclass into Druid.


## Arcane Casters (Wizards and Bards)
Arcane magic requires intensive study, training, and dedication. Divine casters are granted a conduit to the Wellspring by the deities themselves, whereas arcane casters have to forge this connection through their own force of will.
- ### Cantrips
  - #### Access
    - Arcane casters can learn and cast any 0-level spell (Arcane and Divine) as a cantrip.
  - #### Starting
    - Instead of gaining every cantrip, Arcane Casters gain Prestidigitation, Read Magic, and two other cantrips of their choice.
  - #### Casting
    - Cantrips require minimal effort to cast. Arcane Casters may cast cantrips at will and they require no spell slots to cast. Cantrips use basic spellcasting properties, and therefore Arcane Casters do not need to waste spellbook space on them. They can be taught by another Arcane Caster or learned from a text.
  - #### Schools
    - Cantrips are all considered to be Universal for purposes of specialist schools.
- ### Spell Access
  - Arcane Casters may learn spells from either the Bard, Sorcerer, or Wizard spell lists. Spells of levels greater than the Arcane Caster has the ability to cast cannot be copied into a spellbook. Spells are not automatically learned when leveling up, they must be found or purchased and copied into their spellbook in order to be learned.
- ### Spell Preparation
  - Arcane Casters may prepare a number of spells of any level equal to Caster Level + 2 x INT Mod.
- ### Spell Casting
  - Arcane Casters may cast any prepared spell as many times as their spell slots will allow. Bonus spell slots are based on CON, not INT.
- ### Stretching Limits
  - Arcane Casters may attempt to continue to cast spells beyond their allotment for the day. An Arcane Caster attempting to cast a spell for which they no longer have a spell slot remaining must first make a Fortitude save at DC 10 + Spell Level + Number of spells already attempted at that level (successful or otherwise). For example, a 10th-level wizard attempting to cast their third 5th level spell of the day would require a DC 17 Fortitude save (10 + 5 + 2). If the check is successful, the spell is cast normally. If the check fails, the Arcane Caster becomes Fatigued. If they are already Fatigued, they become Exhausted. If they are already Exhausted, they become Nauseated and lose all remaining spell slots of all levels (including the ability to cast cantrips). The Nauseated condition persists until the character has rested for at least an hour, at which point they revert to being Exhausted.
- ### Multiclassing
  - #### Caster Level
    - Arcane Casters who multiclass into the other Arcane Caster class increase their Caster Level when they gain a new level in either class. However, their spells per day max out at base 4 for each level, and they may not cast spells at any level higher than either of their classes would have at their specific levels. Example: a 10th level bard/5th level wizard would have an effective Caster Level of 15, but only have access to 4th level spells.
  - #### School Restrictions
    - All Arcane Casters are specialists as a result of the initial training that they receive. Therefore, bards must also choose an arcane school and opposition schools (if applicable), but do not gain the benefit of the school that wizards do. This carries over if an Arcane Caster multiclasses into the other class - they do not choose a new school for the new class.


## Class Changes
- ### Bard
  - Bards are Arcane Casters.
  - Bards are subject to arcane spell failure if wearing any armor.
