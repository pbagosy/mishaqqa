# Game Changes

## Classes Allowed
Playable classes are: Bard, Cleric, Druid, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Rogue, Wizard
(Apologies to anyone who wanted to play a Barbarian, Ranger, or Sorcerer.)

## Leveling Up
Increasing in level is not an automatic process. While skill rank increases and level adjustments happen immediately when a character has enough experience to increase their level, they must spend at least four days in training, prayer, study, or meditation in order to access the special abilities of their new level.

## Multiclassing
Character classes are more than just descriptions. Learning even the basic skills of each class takes training, and training takes time. In order to have access to any of the abilities of a new class, a character needs at least a month of downtime spent with an instructor, who must have at least four levels in that class.

## Spellcasting
- Spellcasting channels the Wellspring through the caster’s body, and this is taxing on the system. Arcane and Divine casters do not have spell slots. Instead, casters have a number of points based on their caster level (see below).

  Instead of bonus spells for high scores, casters get additional (or fewer!) spell points equal to 2x their CON bonus.

  | Caster Level | Spell Points |  :  | Caster Level | Spell Points |
  | ------------ | ------------ | --- | ------------ | ------------ |
  | 1            | 1            |  :  | 11           | 27           |
  | 2            | 2            |  :  | 12           | 30           |
  | 3            | 4            |  :  | 13           | 33           |
  | 4            | 6            |  :  | 14           | 36           |
  | 5            | 9            |  :  | 15           | 39           |
  | 6            | 12           |  :  | 16           | 42           |
  | 7            | 15           |  :  | 17           | 45           |
  | 8            | 18           |  :  | 18           | 48           |
  | 9            | 21           |  :  | 19           | 51           |
  | 10           | 24           |  :  | 20           | 54           |

- Each spell cast, whether successful or not, costs one point per spell level, spent when the spellcasting is declared. For instance, a wizard spends three spell points to cast Fireball, regardless if the spell is successful or not (for instance, by suffering a successful Attack of Opportunity and failing a Concentration check).

  | Spell Level | Spell Point Cost |
  | ----------- | ---------------- |
  | 1           | 1                |
  | 2           | 2                |
  | 3           | 4                |
  | 4           | 5                |
  | 5           | 6                |
  | 6           | 8                |
  | 7           | 10               |
  | 8           | 11               |
  | 9           | 13               |

## Divine Casters (Clerics, Druids, Paladins):
- ### Patron
  All Divine Casters must select a patron from the Konun Oluhiyat. (Players may not select Zhas’ni as a patron).

- ### Spell Preparation
  Divine Casters may prepare a number of spells of any level equal to Caster Level + (2 x WIS Mod).

- ### Spell Casting
  Divine Casters may cast any spell as many times as their spell points will allow.

- ### Orisons
  Orisons require minimal effort. Divine casters that have access to Orisons may cast them at will and they require no spell points to cast.

- ### Multiclassing
  - #### Magical Incompatibility
    Divine Casters may not multiclass into Arcane Caster classes.
     
  - #### Caster Level
    Divine Casters who multiclass into other Divine Caster classes increase their Caster Level when they gain a new level in another Divine Caster class (Paladins subtract 3 from their caster level). However, they may not cast spells at any level higher than either of their classes would have at their specific level.
    
    **Example:** a 6th level paladin/4th level cleric would have an effective Caster Level of 7, but only have access to 3rd level spells.

  - #### Spell Casting
    Divine Casters may only cast spells which their class has access to, but they may cast it at the lowest level their classes allow. 
    
    **Example:** a 6th level Cleric/4th level Paladin would be able to cast Lesser Restoration at 1st level, but would be unable to cast Greater Magic Weapon.
    
  - #### Patron Consistency
    Druids and Paladins who multiclass into Cleric are restricted to domains associated with their chosen patron deity. Clerics and Paladins who have a patron deity other than The Rampant Lion may not multiclass into Druid.

## Arcane Casters (Wizards and Bards)
Arcane magic requires intensive study, training, and dedication. Whereas Divine Casters are granted a conduit to the Wellspring by the deities themselves, Arcane Casters have to forge this connection through their own force of will.

- ### Cantrips
  - #### Access
    Arcane casters can learn and cast any 0-level spell (Arcane and Divine) as a cantrip.
    
  - #### Starting Cantrips
    Instead of gaining every cantrip, Arcane Casters gain Prestidigitation, Read Magic, and two other cantrips of their choice.
    
  - #### Casting
    Cantrips require minimal effort to cast. Arcane Casters may cast cantrips at will, and they require no spell points to cast. Cantrips use basic spellcasting properties, and therefore Arcane Casters do not need to waste spellbook space on them. They can be taught by another Arcane Caster or learned from a text.
    
  - #### Schools
    Cantrips are all considered to be Universal for purposes of specialist schools.
    
- ### Spell Access
  - Arcane Casters may learn spells from either the Bard, Sorcerer, or Wizard spell lists. Spells of levels greater than the Arcane Caster has the ability to cast cannot be copied into a spellbook. Spells are not automatically learned when leveling up, they must be found or purchased and copied into their spellbook in order to be learned.
  
  - If spells have different levels between Bard, Sorcerer, or Wizard, use the lowest level.
  
- ### Spell Preparation
  Arcane Casters may prepare a number of spells of any level equal to Caster Level + (2 x INT Mod).
  
- ### Spell Casting
  Arcane Casters may cast any prepared spell as many times as their spell points will allow.
  
- ### Multiclassing
  - #### Magical Incompatibility
    Arcane Casters may not multiclass into Divine Caster classes.
 
  - #### Caster Level
    Arcane Casters who multiclass into the other Arcane Caster class increase their Caster Level when they gain a new level in either class. However, they may not cast spells at any level higher than either of their classes would have at their specific levels.
    
    **Example:** a 10th level bard/5th level wizard would have an effective Caster Level of 15, but only have access to 4th level spells.
    
  - #### School Restrictions
    All Arcane Casters are specialists as a result of the initial training that they receive. Therefore, bards must also choose an arcane school and opposition schools (if applicable), but do not gain the benefit of the school that wizards do. This carries over if an Arcane Caster multiclasses into the other class - they do not choose a new school for the new class.

## Class Changes
- ### Bard
  - Bards are Arcane Casters.

  - Bards must choose a specialist school and opposition schools just like a wizard. They are similarly banned from learning spells from their opposition schools.

  - Bards are subject to arcane spell failure if wearing any armor.

- ### Cleric
  - Clerics are Divine Casters.

  - Clerics must select at least one domain from their chosen Aspect. Additionally, they may choose the Healing domain, or Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law, depending on their own alignment.

  - Clerics do not get any additional bonus language options.

- ### Druid
  - Druids are Divine Casters.

  - Druids, like Clerics, are tied to an aspect of the Konun Oluhiyat, specifically The Rampant Lion.

  - Resist Nature’s Lure provides a bonus against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of all Djinns (Ifrits, Marids, Peris, and Deevs).

  - Druids are not restricted from casting alignment-based spells (though there may be moral implications).

- ### Fighter
  - None.

- ### Monk
  - None.

- ### Paladin
  - Paladins are Divine Casters.

  - A Paladin's Caster Level is three less than their class level.
    
    **Example:** A 5th level Paladin has a Caster Level of 2. A 2nd level Paladin has a Caster Level of 0. A 10th level Cleric/10th Level Paladin has a Caster Level of 17. 

- ### Rogue
  - None.

- ### Wizard
  - Wizards are Arcane Casters.
