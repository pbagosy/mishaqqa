# House Rules
## Weapons
Weapons have a chance of breaking in combat. If a natural 1 is rolled for an attack roll, roll percentile dice. If the result is less than or equal to the break chance, the weapon breaks and is rendered useless. Masterwork and magical weapons can potentially be reforged by a master weaponsmith at half their initial cost, but broken magical weapons lose their magical properties when they break.

Weapon come in various grades:

| Grade      | Cost    | Break chance | Bonus                              |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Standard   | As book | 20%          | None                               |
| Superior   | x10     | 10%          | +1 to hit (non-magical)            |
| Masterwork | x20     | 5%           | +1 to hit and damage (non-magical) |

Magical weapons can only be made from masterworks. Masterwork bonuses are not cumulative - a Longsword +1 is still +1 to hit and damage, but it is now magical. For every +1 (including the base) or special property, the break chance reduces by 1%, to a minimum of 1%. For example, a Longsword +1 has a 4% break chance.

## Armor
Armor has a chance of losing its effectiveness if it sustains enough damage.  Each time the wearer loses a cumulative* amount of damage equal to 50% of their maximum HP, roll percentile dice. If the number is less than or equal to the reduction chance, the armor’s AC bonus is reduced by 1. If the armor reaches +0 to AC, it is destroyed. Masterwork and magical armor can be reforged by a master armorer, but broken magical armor loses its magical properties when it is destroyed.

Repairing armor that is damaged but not destroyed takes 1 hour per point of bonus to AC with the appropriate tools. One point can be restored during an 8-hour rest on a successful Craft (Armor) check at DC 10 + Max AC bonus. Other relevant checks may be substituted (i.e., Profession (Leatherworker) for leather armor, Profession (Blacksmith) for plate, etc.).

* It is assumed that lightly damaged armor can be tended to during an 8-hour rest with the appropriate tools, so only count this cumulative damage since that point. I.e., if a character with 50 HP max loses 25, roll for reduction. If they heal, and then lose another 25 HP, roll again. If they lose 10 more HP and then have a long rest, that 10 HP does not carry over and the cumulative damage starts again at 0.


If using both a shield and armor and a reduction check is called for, roll d2. On a 1, the shield must make the check, on a 2, the armor must make the check. If only using a shield, the shield always makes the check when called for.

Armor comes in various grades:

| Grade      | Cost    | Reduction chance | Bonus                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Standard   | As book | 20%              | None                                                                                                   |
| Superior   | x5      | 10%              | +1 to max DEX bonus. -5% Arcane Spell Failure chance (minimum 0%)                                      |
| Masterwork | x10     | 5%               | +1 to max DEX bonus, +1 to armor check penalty (max 0), -10% Arcane Spell Failure chance (minimum 0%). |

Magical armor can only be made from masterworks. Magical armor keeps the masterwork bonuses (and therefore all . For every +1 to AC or special property, lower the reduction chance by 1%, to a minimum of 1%.

New Weapons
Haladie - A double-edged dagger consisting of two blades, attached to a single hilt.
Khopesh - a sickle-shaped sword that evolved from the battle axe.
	
| Name    | Cost | Dmg (S) | Dmg (M) | Critical | Range | Weight | Type   | Special |
| ------- | ---- | ------- | ------- | -------- | ----- | ------ | ------ | ------- |
| Haladie | 10gp | 1d4     | 1d6     | x3       | -     | 1 lb.  | P or S | -       |
| Khopesh | 20gp | 1d6     | 1d8     | 19-20 x2 | -     | 1 lbs. | S      | trip    |


## Confirming Criticals
Natural 20s never need to be confirmed. If a weapon has a critical range greater than 20, any roll lower than 20 needs to be confirmed. Example: a die roll of 19 with a Khopesh would need to be confirmed, while a die roll of 20 would not. 

## Rest and Recovery
8 hours of rest recovers Character Level + CON modifier hit points. A full day’s rest recovers twice this amount.

## Firing Into Combat
When firing at a target that is within 5 feet of another target, on a miss, roll a d6 and, starting from the hex directly above the target and count hexes clockwise. If that hex is occupied, make another attack roll against that target.


## Health Potion Benefits
sing a full-round action to drink a healing potion gives the full effect of the potion. Do not roll, simply regain the maximum possible hit points.


## Melee Critical Failure
When rolling a 1 for a melee weapon attack, your defense slips and you are vulnerable to an Attack of Opportunity from opponents in any threatening hex.

## Ranged Critical Failure
When rolling a 1 for a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with a string (bow, crossbow), the string breaks and must be replaced before it can be fired again (assuming the weapon doesn’t break, as above in Weapons). The attack fails completely and the ammunition is not spent. If a thrown weapon does not hit another target (as described in Firing Into Combat) it travels harmlessly a number of feet equal to 10 times your STR modifier in the direction it was thrown, unless impeded by a wall or other blocking object.
