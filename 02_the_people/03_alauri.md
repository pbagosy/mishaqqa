Descendants of the ancient Achedo people, the Alauri (al-ORE-ee) have lived in the Uzar Desert for thousands of years. Most live in nomadic tribes, moving from oasis to oasis in the harsh and unforgiving land. Their numbers are impossible to ascertain, as tribes will remain hidden in the rocky tablelands for years at a time before emerging to trade. The desert produces gems and precious stones, as well as rare and exotic spices that only the Alauri are able to reach and harvest.

Some Alauri have made permanent homes in [Zarderyâ€™s](/01_the_world/09_zardery.md) small coastal cities, and trade with their wandering kin. These cities tend to be small, often unwalled, but swell into mighty trading hubs during the temperate months. Ships come from all around Mishaqqa to indulge in Alauri goods while seeking to sell their own.
