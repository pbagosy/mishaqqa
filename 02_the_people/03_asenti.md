The Asenti (ass-EN-tee) are a people of many contradictions, hunted and celebrated, cast out and sought after. They live apart from the other peoples of Mishaqqa, but among them. They are viewed with suspicion and distrust, but are relied upon for tasks that others cannot or will not do.

Seemingly descended from Gudzhé people, the Asenti are a mystery to the world, even to themselves. Their history is an oral tradition, and while some scholars have attempted to record it, the telling changes from generation to generation, group to group, and even day to day. Asenti trade in secrets but guard their own very closely. No one is sure when they were established, but some sources point to the ancient Savati people.

Today, the Asenti exist on the fringes of society. There are two distinct groups within the Asenti people: the Korejn, who exist in small ghettos within cities, and the Tuhlak, nomads who travel in caravans consisting of extended families. The two groups intermingle frequently, as caravans travel from one city to another. In the course of most Asenti lives, individuals will live among both. It is considered a rite of passage for Korejn youth to join a caravan and travel the world, and Tuhlak who have tired of the road will settle in Korejn communities. It is in this way that the shared ancestry of the Asenti is preserved. As the Asenti rely on the network of roads between cities to connect their communities, they have almost no presence in the island nations of the Ndaami and Mehrbathi.

Other peoples of Mishaqqa hold many conflicting opinions of the Asenti. For remote settlements, a Tuhlak caravan brings much-needed craftspeople to shoe horses, mend fences, raise buildings, and repair all manner of leather and metal items. Korejn communities provide shops that teem with products from far-flung places, brought by their Tuhlak cousins. Asenti have a reputation of producing high-quality products at competitive prices, and their wares are highly sought after. Conversely, most others view the Asenti as thieves and ne’er-do-wells, disloyal, and untrustworthy. Asenti isolationism and wariness of outsiders is a defense against outsiders, but oftentimes fuels this distrust.

In addition to being skilled crafters, Asenti also have a reputation for being magically potent, particularly in the ways of illusion, enchantment, and divination. Many owe this belief to the color of their eyes, which reminds them of the Mehrbathi. While their talent for magic is not more potent than others, many Asenti are happy to trade on this belief and act as fortune tellers or entertainers. This has led them to be less susceptible to the effects of these kind of spells directed against them.
