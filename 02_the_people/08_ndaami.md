# Ndaami
![Ndaami](../images/ndaami.png)
Descendants of a large [Alauri](/02_the_people/03_alauri.md) tribe who were conquered and absorbed by Aanyat, the most powerful of the ancient Mehrbathi empires, the Ndaami (na-DAHM-ee) were selected over countless generations for their small size to serve as miners, but also showed a great penchant for research and study.

After the Breaking of the Wellspring, the Ndaami rose up against the overlords of Aanyat in a stunning and coordinated campaign that caught the decadent and fading empire off guard. In the chaos that ensued, the Ndaami joined with the largest remaining contingent of [Darmalahi](/02_the_people/05_darmalahi.md) warriors in an exodus away from the strife of the mainland as the empires crumbled.

In order to never be dominated again, they fled to the island of [Serauhai](/01_the_world/07_serauhai.md) and established a nation to protect their interests. Serauhai today remains insular, providing for its people with verdant cropland and rich mines. Despite this, Ndaami are uncommon but not rare on the mainland, with the descendants of those who could not escape or chose to remain behind mixing with those who seek adventure and leave their island home. There is no strife between these groups, and they continue to share a common language.

The Mehrbathi breeding programs selected for two major traits: physical labor in mines and magical research assistants. Many Ndaami excel at one or both of these.

[Paru](/03_cosmology/02_paru_the_desert_owl.md), [Kajiet](/03_cosmology/05_kajiet_the_keeper_of_secrets.md), [Melket](/03_cosmology/04_melket_the_night_shepherd.md), and [Qizhal](/03_cosmology/10_qizhal_the_eternal_mystic.md) tend to be more individually revered.
