# Darmalahi
![Darmalahi](../images/darmalahi.png)
The Darmalahi began as a tribe of Achedo living on the far northern reaches of the Uzar who were renowned for their impressive statures. In the days of the old Gudzhé empires, they offered themselves as mercenaries to one of the larger kingdoms, and left behind their nomadic life. Their leaders began a process of selection that lasted over many generations, choosing the tallest and strongest. They enjoyed a privileged place as elite warriors, and though they remained apart from Gudzhé society, they were renowned and celebrated. They grew to become a distinct people, tall and strong, with a deep martial tradition.

Serving as a warrior class, they bore the brunt of the cataclysmic wars that saw the end of the ancient empires. Rare now, they exist in small communities on the fringes of the great nations, and a number live among the Ndaami.
