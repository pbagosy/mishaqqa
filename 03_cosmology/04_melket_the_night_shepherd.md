## The Night Shepherd
![Melket, The Night Shepherd](../images/the_night_shepherd.png)
The aspect of family, community, and agriculture. Petitioned by those seeking fertility, unification of their communities in a common goal, or favorable harvests. The Night Shepherd appears as a kindly woman of indeterminate age, with large glassy luna moth wings, bearing a staff and wearing simple robes. Her servants tend to adopt small villages and act as healers, midwives, caregivers, and advisors for planting and harvests. They tend to be kindly, patient, and soft-spoken, just as the Night Shepherd herself is when she appears to seekers.
