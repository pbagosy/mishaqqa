## The Keeper of Secrets
![Kajiet, The Keeper of Secrets](../images/the_keeper_of_secrets.png)
The aspect of secret things, thieves, and hidden lovers. Petitioned by those who require discretion, secrecy, and all eyes turned from them. Kajiet blesses skulkers in shadows, lovers seeking discretion, and those who seek answers under the cover of night. The Keeper of Secrets appears as a Ndaami woman, cloaked in darkness, offering a blade in one hand and a scroll of hidden knowledge in the other.
