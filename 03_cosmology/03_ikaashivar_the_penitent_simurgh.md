The aspect of truth, justice, and mercy. Petitioned by jurists, philosophers, prisoners, those suffering or those wishing to ease another’s burden. The Penitent Simurgh’s servants serve as lawyers for the accused or holy warriors seeking to protect the innocent and correct injustice. Many paladins follow the will of the Penitent Simurgh. It appears as an exceptionally large simurgh, typically bowing before seekers before speaking with them.
