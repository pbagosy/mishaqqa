![Zhas’ni, The Whisperer in Shadow](../images/the_whisperer_in_shadow.png)
A rogue aspect of the Konun Oluhiyat, Zhas’ni is an agent of chaos and corruption. Banished to the Eternal Twilight, she still manages to find subtle ways to sway the hearts of humanity, twisting them to her machinations in an attempt to secure her freedom. Zhas’ni appears as a stunningly beautiful Meh’teyar woman with flowing silver hair, bleached white skin covered in intricate tattoos, and jet-black eyes of endless depth. She is served by a host of powerful beings, corrupted ancient Meh’teyar sorcerers and priests who are no longer even remotely human.
