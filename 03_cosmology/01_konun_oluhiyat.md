# Konun Oluhiyat
The Konun Oluhiyat are not gods in the traditional sense. The people of the world have shaped them and given them individual identities that correlate to the way they tend to be experienced and perceived, but the truth of the matter is that they are not truly individual gods, and are quite alien in their thinking. They exist as entities within the Wellspring, divine beings of immense power who have goals and agendas that are unknowable to mortal minds. They tend to be aloof and mysterious, speaking in riddles, conveying their will in signs and omens. If they have a grand plan, they do not consider the peoples of Mishaqqa worthy of knowing or understanding it.

These beings have left a number of powerful artifacts that allow them to communicate more directly, which they use on rare occasions to push mortals toward their mysterious ends. These artifacts are powerful constructs that have become sacred relics. Each corresponds to an aspect of the Konun Oluhiyat.

## Alignment
The Konun Oluhiyat have no alignment, *per se* (except for Zhas'ni), and can be assumed to be True Neutral. Each worshiper experiences them differently, and will attribute alignment to them as they interpret them.

## Worshippers
Nearly everyone is a worshiper of the Konun Oluhiyat to some degree. The names they have been given are known to most, and most people consider one aspect to represent them above the others.  All of their names, however, are invoked in daily conversation, as blessings, curses, or simple entreaties that the powers look favorably upon endeavors or turn their eyes away.

## Priesthood
The church that has grown to represent the temporal will of the Oluhiyat is as diverse, incongruous, and inconsistent as the beings it worships. Each nation and city has a different interpretation of Their will for its people. The church, in its many incarnations, tends to be a powerful political entity, as it has a near monopoly on interpreting the will of the Konun Oluhiyat. However, very few of the priesthood have an actual divine connection.  The Konun Oluhiyat invests certain followers with a fragment of their power, conveying the ability to wield divine magic, and making them more receptive to direct communication. This investment almost always happens at one of the sacred relics. The church itself has no control over who is invested with this power, but with only rare exceptions, it occurs at one of the sacred relics, and typically only on equinoxes. Therefore these sites have become the focus of pilgrimage, with faithful hopefuls flocking in the hopes of becoming a fully divine priest. Only a rare few are granted this investment, but they flourish in enough numbers to make reality out of the existence of the Konun Oluhiyat.

## Domains
Clerics select an aspect of the Konun Oluhiyat that they are invested to exemplify. They must choose at least one of that aspect’s domains, and additionally may choose the Healing domain, or Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law, depending on their alignment.

Paladins also select an aspect. Most paladins are invested by the Penitent Simurgh, though any can be chosen. Druids, however, are always invested by the Rampant Lion.

## Favored Weapon
Clerics are proficient in their aspect’s favored weapon.
