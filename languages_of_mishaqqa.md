# Languages of Mishaqqa
## Common Languages

### Alauric (ah-LORE-ick)
Spoken primarily in Sarderi by the Alauri people, but also found in enclaves within the Edryn lands.  It is descended from Old Edryc.

### Ashkevati (ASH-kev-AHT-ee)
One of the two main Mehrbathi languages. Spoken primarily in Ashkeva.  It is descended from Ajhil.

### Edryc (ED-rick)
Spoken by the Edryn, with three distinct dialects - Kyn (spoken in Kynedryn), Zhym (spoken in Zhymedryn), and Sanh (spoken in Dal-Pelat). They are drifting apart, and while generally intelligible to each other, there are strong idiomatic differences and accents can lead to miscommunication.  It is descended from Old Edryc. 

### Keshtowara (KESH-toe-war-ah)
Spoken primarily by the Wara people of Kezhmedai.  It is descended from Uushic.

### Tuulam (TOO-lahm)
Spoken by the Tuulo people in Tezhan. It is descended from Uushic.

### Erazeti (AIR-ah-ZET-ee)
One of the two main Mehrbathi languages. Spoken primarily in Erazet. It is descended from Mehrbaashyn.


### Uilrim (OIL-rim)
The common tongue of the Ndaami. Spoken in Serauhai and small enclaves where the Ndaami find themselves.  It is descended from Uushic, but split much earlier than Keshtowara and Tuulam and shares very little in common with them. Dialects have shifted slightly depending on local influence, but aside from a few loanwords, all Uilrim speakers are fully intelligible to each other.

## Uncommon Languages
These languages have very few speakers.

### Draconic
The high language of dragons.

### Gashkun (GASH-koon)
Spoken only by the Gashki.  Gashki is not typically written, and relies heavily on loanwords from other languages. Non-Gashki (hudruu, in Gashkun), are rarely taught the language. It has no commonalities with any other spoken languages and is unclear where it descends from.

### Simurgh
The high language of simurghs. Some wizards believe that the incantations to channel the Wellspring are taken from the Simurgh tongue, but most linguists disagree.

## Dead Languages
These languages no longer have living speakers, either due to the fall of empires or other languages having supplanted them entirely. They exist only in scattered writings.

### Ajhil (AHJ-eel)
The official language of the ancient Aja'hulaam empires.

### Akrashyn (AHK-rash-een)
Thought to be the original language of those who first came to Mishaqqa.

### Qal'mirari (KAHL-mih-RAR-ee)
The official language of Qal’mar, the largest of the Mah'teyar empires.

### Mehrbaashyn (MER-bosh-een)
The universal trade tongue of the ancient Mehrbathi empires and eventually the official language of the Shulf’eta empires.

### Mohrrian (MORE-ee-an)
An ancient tongue spoken by the ancestors of Wara.

### Old Edryc
The language from which both Edryc and Alauric are descended from.

### Syvashin (SIV-ash-een)
The official language of the ancient Shulf'eta empires, though it had been supplanted by Mehrbaashyn by the time of the Kinslaying.

### Uushic (OOSH-ick)
The root of the Tuulam, Keshtowara, and Uilrim languages.
