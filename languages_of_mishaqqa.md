# Languages of Mishaqqa
## Common Languages

### Alauric
(ah-LORE-ick) Spoken primarily in [Zardery](/01_the_world/09_zardery.md) by the [Alauri](/02_the_people/02_alauri.md) people, but also found in enclaves within the Edryn lands.  It is descended from [Old Edryc](#old-edryc).

### Ashkevati
(ASH-kev-AHT-ee) One of the two main Mehrbathi languages. Spoken primarily in [Ashkeva](/01_the_world/02_ashkeva.md).  It is descended from [Ajhil](#ajhil).

### Edryc
(ED-rick) Spoken by the [Edryn](/02_the_people/04_edryn.md), with three distinct dialects - Kyn (spoken in [Kynhadryn](/01_the_world/06_kynhadryn.md)), Zhym (spoken in [Zhimhadryn](/01_the_world/10_zhimhadryn.md)), and Sanh (spoken in [Dal-Pelat](/01_the_world/03_dal_pelat.md)). They are drifting apart, and while generally intelligible to each other, there are strong idiomatic differences and accents can lead to miscommunication.  It is descended from [Old Edryc](#old-edryc). 

### Keshtowara
(KESH-toe-war-ah) Spoken primarily by the [Wara](/02_the_people/10_wara.md) people of [Kesh'medai](/01_the_world/05_kesh_medai.md).  It is descended from [Uushic](#uushic).

### Tuulam
(TOO-lahm) Spoken by the [Tuulo](/02_the_people/09_tuulo.md) people in [Tuzhan](/01_the_world/08_tuzhan.md). It is descended from [Uushic](#uushic).

### Erazeti
(AIR-ah-ZET-ee) One of the two main Mehrbathi languages. Spoken primarily in [Erazet](/01_the_world/04_erazet.md). It is descended from [Mehrbaashyn](#mehrbaashyn).

### Uilrim
(OIL-rim) The common tongue of the [Ndaami](/02_the_people/07_ndaami.md). Spoken in [Serauhai](/01_the_world/07_serauhai.md) and small enclaves where the Ndaami find themselves.  It is descended from [Uushic](#uushic), but split much earlier than [Keshtowara](#keshtowara) and [Tuulam](#tuulam) and shares very little in common with them. Dialects have shifted slightly depending on local influence, but aside from a few loanwords, all Uilrim speakers are fully intelligible to each other.

## Uncommon Languages
These languages have very few speakers.

### Draconic
The high language of dragons.

### Gashkun
(GASH-koon) Spoken only by the [Gashki](/02_the_people/06_gashki.md).  Gashki is not typically written, and relies heavily on loanwords from other languages. Non-Gashki (*hudruu*, in Gashkun), are rarely taught the language. It has no commonalities with any other spoken languages and is unclear where it descends from.

### Simurgh
The high language of simurghs. Some wizards believe that the incantations to channel the Wellspring are taken from the Simurgh tongue, but most linguists disagree.

## Dead Languages
These languages no longer have living speakers, either due to the fall of empires or other languages having supplanted them entirely. They exist only in scattered writings.

### Syvashin
(SIV-ash-een) The official language of the ancient [Shulf'eta](/02_the_people/08_shulf_eta.md) empires, though it had been supplanted by [Mehrbaashyn](#mehrbaashyn) by the time of the Kinslaying.

### Uushic
(OOSH-ick) The root of the [Tuulam](#tuulam), [Keshtowara](#keshtowara), and [Uilrim](#uilrim) languages.
